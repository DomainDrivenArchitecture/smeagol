# Welcome to the Levellers Wiki

This is a sort of loose online thinktank for the radical left in rural Scotland.

## Latest additions

* [[Birnam workshop]]
* [[Holding size]]
* [[Local Government: key policy issues]]

## Everything is new

And in fact there's not much here yet. The software is also new and may break; if it does, please contact [[Simon]].

## Come and join in

This isn't an 'anybody can edit it' wiki; it's a bunch of people all of whom more or less know each other, trying to get a consistent policy platform together. But we aren't seeking to be exclusive. If you'd like to join the editing group, please contact [[Simon]].

## Please feel free to use our ideas

This is not a party political wiki, although some of us may be members of the Greens, the SNP, or other parties. We'd be very pleased if any party adopted policy we develop.
